# PASTA Model Framework
> Processs of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis

## Scenario 
Youâ€™re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. 

You are performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.

## Components of PASTA
* Define Business and Security Objectives
* Define the Technical Scope
* Decompose Application (Data flow diagram)
* Threat analysis
* Vulnerability analysis
* Attack modeling (Attack tree)
* Risk anaylsis and impact

## Implementation

### Define Business and Security Objectives 
|Business| Security |
|---|---|
|Process transactions|One account, one payment method|
|Users can create profiles| Protected by passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication|
|Accept multiple payment methods| The app should be in compliance with PCI-DSS|
|Database utilization |Provide multi-factor authentication|

Context Diagram:
  
|Users|Admins|
|---|---|
|Add sneakers to cart|Store & update catalogs|
|Pay for products/service|Issue invoice|
|Send inquiry |Answer inquiry|

### Define the Technical Scope
* API to connect the exchange of data between customers, employees and customers.
* Public key infrastructure (PKI)
* SHA-256 (Hash functions to protect the sensitive data from being viewed by administrators or anyone)
* SQL
  
### Decompose Application
Data Flow Diagram Level 0 or Context Diagram:
In this case, I did not include level 1 and 2 as it might be way more complex.

### Threat Analysis
* SQL Injection
* Session Hijacking
* Denial-of-service
* Denial of service, integration issues, service disruptions
 
### Vulnerability Analysis
* Lack of prepared statements (parameterized query, is a powerful tool in SQL that helps prevent SQL injection attacks and improve database performance.)
* Weak credential logins
* Overloaded app server
* Broken API Token

### Attack Modelling
Attack tree diagram:

### Risk Analysis and Impact 
* SHA-256 Hashing
* Incident response procedures
* Playbook (security policy)
* Password policy
* Principle of least privilege
* Zero-trust
